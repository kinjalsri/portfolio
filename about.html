      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Kinjal Srivastava. A passionate coder and a dedicated
        musician, I find joy in the art of creating both through lines of code
        and musical notes. As a keen learner, I thrive on challenges, constantly
        seeking ways to expand my creative horizons. Embracing the dynamic world
        of technology while expressing myself through melodies, I am on a
        journey to harmonize my love for coding and music.
